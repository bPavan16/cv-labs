## Comparative Analysis of Edge Detection Methods

### Description
A Python script to compare the performance of Gaussian, Sobel, and Canny edge detection methods on a given set of images. Metrics such as edge detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and noise robustness are measured and presented in a comparative analysis report.

### Features
- Implements Gaussian, Sobel, and Canny edge detection.
- Measures and compares:
  - Edge detection accuracy.
  - Computational efficiency.
  - Noise robustness.
- Generates a detailed analysis report.

## RANSAC Implementation for Robust Linear Regression

### Description
A Python function to implement the RANSAC algorithm for robust linear regression. The function estimates the parameters of a linear model that best fits the inliers in a dataset with outliers.

### Features
- Implements the RANSAC algorithm.
- Works with synthetic datasets containing known outliers.
- Visualizes inliers, outliers, and the fitted linear model.

## Harris Corner Detection

### Description
A Python function to implement the Harris corner detection algorithm for identifying corner points in images.

### Features
- Detects corner points using the Harris corner detector.
- Supports images with varying corner densities.
- Visualizes detected corner points overlaid on the original images.

---

## Feature Matching Using RANSAC

### Description
An extended implementation of the RANSAC algorithm for feature matching between two images based on their local descriptors.

### Features
- Detects keypoints using the Harris corner detector.
- Uses SIFT descriptors for matching keypoints.
- Applies RANSAC to estimate the transformation matrix between matched keypoints.
- Visualizes matched features.

## Difference of Gaussians (DoG) Implementation

### Description
A Python function to compute the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) for a given input image. The function performs convolution of the image with two Gaussian kernels of different standard deviations and computes their difference.

### Features
- Computes DoG for images at different scales.
- Visualizes the resulting images to observe the effect of scale.
